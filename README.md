A Demo of Dropwizard/Spring Integration

I recommend using Spring Boot. But in case you do not have that option, and you still want to integrate Spring framework into your Dropwizard project.

This project uses following libraries:
- Dropwizard (and then all the libraries that it brings)
- Spring
- jose4j (JWT authentication)
- Swagger UI (REST API Test Console. It is powerful, but design is ugly from a modern point of view ..)
